# Build Tools

## Learning Objectives

* Define build tools
* Introduce available build tools
* Compare and contrast Gulp to Rake
* Use build tools to automate workflow

## Framing (5 min)

Build Tools are software that allows us to speed up and automate our work, including compiling our code, minification, concatenation, server automatic browser reloading, etc..

<details>
<summary>
Q. What is minified code, and why do we minify code?</summary>

Code in which all unnecessary characters have been removed from source code without changing its functionality at all. It allows for a faster response and significantly reduces the size of the code, requiring less bandwidth.

<br>
<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Q. When have you seen minified code before?</summary>

CDNs for JavaScript tools like jQuery and Angular

<br>
<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Q. What does it mean to compile code? What compiled languages have you heard of, and what languages do they compile to?</summary>


Compiling code (sometimes called preprocessing) is taking a file written in one language, like SASS, and running a special "compiler" program to convert it into a new file written in the language we want. For the browser, we can compile SASS into CSS and CoffeeScript into JavaScript. 

<br>
<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Q. What tool did we use in Rails to help concatenate and minify our JS and CSS? Why do we want concatenation?</summary>

Rails Asset Pipeline, which helped to concatenate all JS and CSS files into one, allowing us to speed up our application and serving of static files.

<br>
<br>
</details>

<br>

In summary, build tools help us complete tasks like compiling and minifying code so we don't have to do those things manually and repeatedly.

We are going to breifly touch on two popular options for build tools: Gulp and Webpack.

## Gulp (5 min)

<img src="gulp.jpg" width="50px">

Gulp is an popular open-source automation tool built on Node.js that runs tasks to manipulate files in your application.

It is commonly used for bundling, minificiation, ES6 support, etc..

[Gulp Documentation](http://gulpjs.com/)

It's really similar to `rake` in Ruby.

Rake is used to help automate a bunch of tasks for us when building Rails applications. In Rails 5, most of `rake`'s jobs are available through the `rails` command for convenience. 

Here are examples of these `rake` tasks:

```
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake assets:precompile
```

Today, we'll look at ways to accomplish tasks like these when we're not working with Ruby or Rails. 

## You-Do: Gulp Linter Example (15 min)

### Gulp Installation

To install globally:
```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

To install as dependency in project:
```bash
$ npm install gulp --save-dev
```

>Note: writing `--save-dev` instead of `--save` adds a separate  `"devDependencies"` object in `package.json`.  Don't worry too much about the difference for now; just know these plugins would be used differently in production!

```bash
$ touch `gulpfile.js`
```
>This needs to be installed in your root directory and will contain all of your related task configuration

Now let's run `gulp` in terminal:

```bash
$ gulp

```
```bash

[10:36:31] Using gulpfile ~/GeneralAssembly/WDI/build-tools/gulp-example/gulpfile.js
[10:36:32] Task 'default' is not in your gulpfile
[10:36:32] Please check the documentation for proper gulpfile formatting


```
>Uh oh! - we ran into a problem! We need to define a `gulp task`.

### Gulp Tasks

<details>
<summary>
Q. What is a task?</summary>
<br>

```

In Gulp, we create tasks that can transform our code. `gulp.task` is a method which we use to define our tasks. Its arguments are the task name, it's dependencies and callback function.

```
<br>
<br>
</details>

----------

In `gulpfile.js`, we need to include the `gulp` module. To do this, we first require `gulp` and save the package's exports as a variable.  This will allow us to call upon Gulp to create a task.


```js
// gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp');
```

### My First (Default) Task

By default, Gulp requires a default task. It is the first task that Gulp will look for when reading your `gulpfile.js`.

Let's define our first (default) task in `gulpfile.js`:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');

//define a task with the name of 'default'
// and a callback to perform when the task is run
gulp.task('default', function() {
  console.log('I am the default task!');
});
```

In your terminal, try running `gulp` again.

>Now, Gulp should be able to find the default task in your `gulpfile.js`. It will then execute the callback that you define for your task.

You should see something like the following:

```bash
[10:37:37] Using gulpfile ~/GeneralAssembly/WDI/build-tools/gulp-example/gulpfile.js
[10:37:37] Starting 'default'...
I am the default task!
[10:37:37] Finished 'default' after 104 Î¼s
```

<details>
<summary>
Q. We used the string `'default'`. Do you think it matters what we call this task?
</summary>
<br>

Yes, and no. While you can certainly change `default` to `wombat`, it would not be very descriptive of the task.

Also, for whatever you define 'name' as in your task (`gulp.task('name', callbackFunction)`), you run the task by runnign the following in the command line:

`$ gulp <name>`

The name `default` is special in Gulp, though. If our task's name is `default`, we can just run `$ gulp`.

</details>


## You-Do: Write your own gulp task (5 min)

Let's get more practice writing Gulp tasks. Write a task that will `console.log` today's date once's it run.

[See A Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/build-tools/blob/joe_updates/gulpDateTask.js)

## Plugins (5 min)

[Gulp plugins](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/)

In addition to letting us write our own tasks completely by hand, Gulp has many plugins that we can use in our applications. We will instull these Gulp plugins are installed individually using `npm install <dependency-name> --save-dev`. 

## You-Do: Jshint Plugin Example (15 min)

We are going to be working with the `gulp-jshint` and `jshint-stylish` plugins so we can easily identify any JavaScript errors in our code!

```bash
$ npm install jshint gulp-jshint --save-dev
$ npm install jshint-stylish --save-dev
```

Make sure all of these dependencies are `require`d in the `gulpfile`.

```js
var gulp   = require('gulp');
var jshint = require('gulp-jshint');
var stylish = require('jshint-stylish');
```

Now, let's add our task!

```js
gulp.task('jshint', function() {
  return gulp.src('./js/*.js')
  .pipe(jshint())
  .pipe(jshint.reporter(stylish));
});
```
<details>
<summary>
Q. What is `gulp.src`?
</summary>
<br>
`gulp.src` specifies file source paths. It can also take an array of source paths. 
<br>
<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Q. What do you think `'./js/*.js'` represents ?
</summary>
<br>

The `*` is looking for any file ending in `.js` in the specified directory.

Essentially, it's saying we want to lint all of of JavaScript files in the `js` directory.

<br>
<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Q. What is the `.pipe()` method doign in the snippet above?
</summary>
<br>

`.pipe()` is used to pipe (or send) the source file/files into a plugin. These pipes can chain tasks together so you can add as many dependencies as you need!

<br>
<br>
</details>
--------------

Now, run the following in your command line:

``` bash
$ gulp jshint
```

<details>
<summary>
Q. What is the `jshint` method doign in the snippet above?
</summary>
<br>

`.pipe()` is used to pipe (or send) the source file/files into a plugin. These pipes can chain tasks together so you can add as many dependencies as you need!

<br>
<br>
</details>

>Note: Instead of calling this task `jshint`, we could have added this as our `default` task. Then, we would simply run `$ gulp` instead.


## Gulp SASS 

### Gulp-SASS

Let's use Gulp to compile our `sass` into `css`!

We are going to be using the following `gulp-sass` plugin: [Gulp-Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass).

Feel free to continue along on the same `gulpfile.js`. However, always feel free to checkout to `jshint-solution` as well for working code.

First, let's install and save our plugin:

```bash
$ npm install gulp-sass --save-dev

```

Next, let's require the `gulp-sass` dependency:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require("gulp-sass");
```

And then let's add a new task:

```js
gulp.task('sass', function () {
 return gulp.src('./css/**/*.scss')
   .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
   .pipe(gulp.dest('./css/'))
});
```

<details>
<summary>
Q. What do we see here in this task thats different?
</summary>
<br>

1. `sass.logError`, which will display an error

2. `gulp.dest()` - this will copy our results to a given directory. In this case, to our `css` directory.

<br>
<br>
</details>

```bash
$ gulp sass
```

Great, it worked! But how is that helpful to our workflow?

> While Gulp does a great job of executing these types of tasks well, it becomes extremely powerful when we start compose these different tasks together.

### Gulp Watch and Connect

We are going to add two more dependencies to help automate these tasks further.  Our goal is to see any SASS changes reflected immediately without manually reloading the server or refreshing our browser. We can also run tasks one after the other automatically to make the process faster during development.

The two new dependencies are [Gulp Watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-watch) and [Gulp Connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-connect).


```bash
$ npm install gulp-watch --save-dev

$ npm install gulp-connect --save-dev

```

```js

var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var watch = require('gulp-watch');
var connect = require('gulp-connect');
```

```js
gulp.task('watch', function () {
 gulp.watch('./css/**/*.scss', ['sass']);
});

```

```js
gulp.task('connect', function() {
  connect.server({
    livereload: true
  })
});

```
<details>
<summary>
Q. Check the documentation. What is `gulp.watch()` doing ?
</summary>
<br>

It's a method that checks to see if a file was saved.  It's "watching" our SASS file for changes.
<br>
<br>
</details>


<details>
<summary>
Q. What is `connect.server({livereload: true})` doing?
</summary>
<br>

```

Reloading and Refreshing our browser without us have to do so manually. It's going to start up a web server that will allows us to reload our complied files and refresh our browser automatically.

```
<br>
<br>
</details>

------

Let's now add `.pipe(connect.reload())` to our `sass` task:

```
gulp.task('sass', function () {
 return gulp.src('./css/**/*.scss')
   .pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
   .pipe(gulp.dest('./css/'))
   .pipe(connect.reload());
});

```
Finally, let's add the following at the bottom of our `gulpfile.js`:

```
gulp.task('default', ['sass', 'connect', 'watch']);

```

```bash
$ gulp

```

<details>
<summary>
Q. Why do we not need to specify our task in the above command?
</summary>
<br>

```
Because we used `default`, gulp will automatically execute the `default` command
```
<br>
<br>
</details>

```
[13:25:59] Using gulpfile ~/wdi8/sandbox/bamsay/gulpfile.js
[13:25:59] Starting 'sass'...
[13:25:59] Starting 'connect'...
[13:25:59] Finished 'connect' after 18 ms
[13:25:59] Starting 'watch'...
[13:25:59] Finished 'watch' after 15 ms
[13:25:59] Server started http://localhost:8080
[13:25:59] LiveReload started on port 35729
[13:25:59] Finished 'sass' after 72 ms
[13:25:59] Starting 'default'...
[13:25:59] Finished 'default' after 3.63 Î¼s

```
## Break (10 min)

## Webpack (10 mins)

[Webpack Documentation](https://webpack.github.io/)

webpack is known as a "code bundler". It is used to bundle JavaScript files to run in our browsers, and can be used for transforming, bundling, or packaging assets and resources.

In essence, it takes your code, transforms and bundles it, then returns a brand new version of your code.

We will be using Webpack with React! You will see that React uses something called JSX, which leads to a fairly large cost in size. Webpack alleviates this somewhat by compiling and bundling the code together.

While Gulp is known as a "task runner", webpack does a little more. Task runners will compile your code as shown in the previous section. Webpack similarly can compile code, but takes things a step further by *bundling* modules and files together. What does that mean exactly?

In short, it allows for faster development.  Task runners like Gulp and Grunt need to rebuild the entire application every time you save.  Bundlers like webpack only rebuild the modules you have specifically edited!

### You-do: Setup

`git checkout webpack_starter`

run: `npm install -g webpack`
run: `npm install webpack --save-dev`

Try testing it out by running `webpack` in the terminal

You should see something like:

```bash
webpack 1.12.12
Usage: https://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html

Options:
  --help, -h, -?
  --config
  --context
  --entry
...
  --display-cached-assets
  --display-reasons, --verbose, -v

Output filename not configured.
```

<details>
<summary>
What does this tell us?
</summary>
<br>

```
We haven't configured what we actually want to do with webpack yet!
```
<br>
<br>
</details>

## STOP (5 mins)

### You Do: Configuring the Webpack (10 mins)

To actually configure our webpack, we need to create a new file in the root of our directory: `webpack.config.js`

Here we will need to define the folders and files that we want bundled, as well as any additional functionality from our tool. We are going to add in a few pieces of code:

```js
var path = require('path');

var PATHS = {
  js: path.join(__dirname, 'js'),
  build: path.join(__dirname, 'build')
};
```

<details>
<summary>
What do you think this first part is doing?
</summary>
<br>

```
This simply defines two folders within our app that we will be either reading or modifying with webpack.

*Note* 'path' is a node method
```
<br>
<br>
</details>

```js
module.exports = {
  // Entry accepts a path or an object of entries. We'll be using the
  // latter form given it's convenient with more complex configurations.
  entry: {
    js: PATHS.js
  }
```

<details>
<summary>
What do you think this next section does?
</summary>
<br>

```
Here we are defining the entry point of our webpack. In other words, whatdirectory do we want to look into and bundle?
```
<br>
<br>
</details>

Lastly, we will need to define the output. Where are we going to put thebundled code?

```js
,
  output: {
    path: PATHS.build,
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
};
```  

**Try running `webpack` in your terminal again. What happens?**

Check out your public folder and see what file was added in!

## STOP (10 mins)

Having to run `webpack` every time you make a change will get frustrating (and boring) quickly. We can set up the `webpack-dev-server` to help us out!

One of the best features of the dev server is [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) (HMR). This is a feature provided by webpack that will update specific modules live. In other words, we can potentially update specific parts of our app without having the refresh the entire page!

### You Do: Setting up Webpack Server (10 mins)

To get started, run the following in you command line:

`npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev`

We can now add this directly to our `package.json` file, allowing us the ability to start up our application immediately on the webpack dev server. Include the following in your `scripts` object in the `package.json` file:

`"start": "webpack-dev-server --content-base build"`

Go ahead and run `npm start` in your terminal. You should see something like:

![npm Start](npmStart.png)

If you open your browser to `localhost:8080`, you should see your index.html and any html rendered through your index.js file on the browser!

This is cool and all, but not really any different than before other than running a different command in your terminal. We want to be able to make changes to our code and see the updates without having to do any additional refreshing.

We will have to install another package to get this up and running: `npm i webpack-merge --save-dev`

This package allows us to merge objects together. In this case, we will be merging the object that sets our paths, with HMR.

In webpack.config.js, include the following on line 2:

```js
var merge = require('webpack-merge');
var webpack = require('webpack');
var TARGET = process.env.npm_lifecycle_event;
```

We will then replace everything from `module.exports` and down with the following:

```js
var common = {

  // Entry accepts a path or an object of entries. We'll be using the
  // latter form given it's convenient with more complex configurations.
  entry: {
    app: PATHS.js
  },
  output: {
    path: PATHS.build,
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
};

// Default configuration
if(TARGET === 'start' || !TARGET) {
  module.exports = merge(common, {});
}

if(TARGET === 'build') {
  module.exports = merge(common, {});
}
```

<details>
<summary>
What is this doing??
</summary>
<br>

```
Depending on the command we run (start, or build) we will be merging the 'common' object with whatever we include in the empty objects
```
<br>
<br>
</details>

Now all we are missing is adding in the HMR. Let's edit the first `if` statement to include this:

```js
if(TARGET === 'start' || !TARGET) {
  module.exports = merge(common, {
    devServer: {
      contentBase: PATHS.build,
      // Enable history API fallback so HTML5 History API based
      // routing works. This is a good default that will come
      // in handy in more complicated setups.
      historyApiFallback: true,
      hot: true,
      inline: true,
      progress: true,
      // Display only errors to reduce the amount of output.
      stats: 'errors-only',
      // Parse host and port from env so this is easy to customize.
      // If you use Vagrant or Cloud9, set
      // host: process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';
      // 0.0.0.0 is available to all network devices unlike default
      // localhost
      host: process.env.HOST,
      port: process.env.PORT
    },
    plugins: [
      new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()
    ]
  });
}
```

And remove ` --content-base build` from your `package.json`

**COOL**. Everytime we make a change to the js file and save the browser is automatically updated!

## You Do: Add in CSS watch! (10 mins)

We already have the setup done, so adding in CSS watch is simple!

We'll need another package for this:

`npm i css-loader style-loader --save-dev`

We then need to add the use of this package in as a module within our `common` variable after `output`:

```js
,
module: {
  loaders: [
    {
      // Test expects a RegExp! Note the slashes!
      test: /\.css$/,
      loaders: ['style', 'css'],
      // Include accepts either a path or an array of paths.
      include: PATHS.css
    }
  ]
}
```

If you run it now, an error about "Promise" will pop up. This is an ES6 bug that can be fixed with [this](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise#nodejs):

`npm install es6-promise`

`var Promise = require('es6-promise').Promise;`

Something still seems off.. Notice the `include:`.  That is pointing to a `PATHS.css`, but we haven't created that yet! Let's go ahead and add that in.  

<details>
<summary>
Try to think about what to do here before looking at the answer!
</summary>
<br>

```
Inside your PATHS object, add `css: path.join(__dirname, 'css')`. Then, within your `common.entry` include `css: PATHS.css`
```
<br>
<br>
</details>

Go to your `style.css` and change the background to green, what happens?? Notice how the page does *not* refresh!
